#Python_Programming Chapter 2
#The end assignment from chapter 2

#Challenges:
#1 Create a list of legal and illegal variable names. Explain them.
#2 Write a program that allows the user to enter his or her favorite foods. The program should print out the name of a new food by joining the two names.
#3 Write a Tipper program where the user enters a restaurant bill total. The program should then display the two amounts: a 15% tip and a 20% tip.
#4 Write a Car Salesmen program where the user enters the base price of a car.The program should add on a bunch of extra fees such as tax, license a percent of the base price. The other fees should be set as values. Display the actual price of the care once all the extras are applied.


#1 the following comments show illegal and legal variables and state why they are illegal.
#  1apple is a illegal variable name, because it starts with a number
# beta1234 is a legal but bad variable name, because it doesn't describe what it represents
# Name is a bad illegal variable name because it starts with an uppercase letter
# what_is_your_name is a bad variable name because it is to long
# good variables start with a lowercase letter, are consistent I like to use the underscore
# good variables are descriptive and short, other programmers should know what your variable stands for.



#2 code to combine the two favorite foods of the user.
food_1=input("Hi! What is your favorite food? ")
food_2=input("and what is your second favorite food?")
new_food=food_1+food_2
print("Combining these foods will give you, ", new_food)

#3 tip code, this code describes how much the user must pay at a certain amount of tip
bill=int( input("\nWhat is the total of the restaurant bill?"))
tip_1=0.15*bill
tip_2=0.20*bill
print("If you want to give a tip of 15% you'll need to give, ", tip_1)
print("If you want to give a tip of 20% you'll need to give, ", tip_2)

#4 the car sale. Get the base price and add the fees to calculate the total price of the car
base_price=int(input("\nHow much is the base price of the car?"))
# add fees: 8% sales tax 25% environment tax.
sale_tax=0.08*base_price
environment_tax=0.25*base_price
# calculate the total price of the car
car_price=base_price+sale_tax+environment_tax
# print the total price, to show the salesmen what the price will become
print("The total price of the car including fees is:", car_price)

#exit statement
input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
