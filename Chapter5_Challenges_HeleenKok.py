#Student Number: S1183435
#Python_Programming Chapter 5
#The end assignment from chapter 5

# Challenges:
# 1. Create a program that prints a list of words in random order. The program should print all the words and not repeat any.
# 2. Write a Character Creator program for a role-playing game. The player should be given a pool of 30 points to spend on four attributes: Strength, Health, Wisdom, and Dexterity. The player should be able to spend points from the pool on any attribute and should also be able to take points from an attribute and put them back into the pool.
# 3. Write a Whoâ€™s Your Daddy? program that lets the user enter the name of a male and produces the name of his father. (You can use celebrities, fictional characters, or even historical figures for fun.) Allow the user to add, replace, and delete son- father pairs.


# 1. Random words from a list. Only print the words once
# first import random
# make a list called words
# pick a random word from the list
# make a loop to check if the word is printed already
# is the word is not printed print the word, els pick another word

# start
print(
"""
